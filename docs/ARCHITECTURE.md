# Architecture

Domain AI is a single-module Android app using MVVM, Jetpack Compose, and a small
hand-rolled dependency container. The design centers on one idea: **a single,
auditable policy core decides where every message is answered and enforces every
privacy guarantee on the way out.**

## Layers

```

└── privacy/
    ├── PrivacyState              Pure config (kill switch, consent, redaction).
    ├── PrivacySettings           DataStore-backed persistence of PrivacyState.

```

## Data flow for one message

1. `ChatScreen` collects `ChatUiState` from `ChatViewModel`.
2. User taps send. For both local and cloud sends, `ChatRepository.send` appends
   the user message and calls `PrivacyRouter.answer`.
3. `PrivacyRouter`:
   - `useCloud == false` → answer **LOCAL**, always.
   - `useCloud == true` → `NetworkGuard.assertNetworkAllowed` must pass (kill
     switch off **and** consent given) or it falls back to LOCAL with a note.
   - Before any cloud call, the prompt **and history** are redacted; the redacted
     text that was sent is recorded so the UI can show it on the reply.
   - On any cloud error, it falls back to LOCAL — the user is never left without a
     reply, and never silently escalated.
4. The reply (with its `Route` and, for cloud, the exact redacted text that was
   sent) is appended and the conversation is persisted encrypted.

## Why a separate `PrivacyState`

`PrivacyState` is a pure data class with no Android dependencies, so the router
and guard logic that consume it are unit-testable on the JVM. `PrivacySettings`
(DataStore) is the only Android-coupled piece, and it merely persists that state.

## Testability

`PrivacyRouter`, `NetworkGuard`, and `PiiRedactor` are pure Kotlin and covered by
JVM unit tests. Engines are injected behind the `InferenceEngine` interface, so
tests use fakes and never need a model or a network.

## The on-device engine (`:llama` native module)

The real local model runs through a native module:

```
llama/
├── build.gradle.kts                 com.android.library + externalNativeBuild (arm64-v8a)
└── src/main/
    ├── java/sg/act/domain/llama/LLamaAndroid.kt   Kotlin wrapper; all native
    │                                                calls on one dedicated thread
    └── cpp/
        ├── CMakeLists.txt           add_subdirectory(llama.cpp); links llama + log
        ├── llama-android.cpp        JNI bridge (load/context/batch/sampler/decode)
        └── llama.cpp/               vendored llama.cpp source (pinned commit)
```

- `LLamaAndroid` owns the llama.cpp context and exposes `load`/`unload`/`send`
  (a `Flow<String>` of token deltas). The context is single-threaded, so every
  native call is serialized on one executor.
- `LlamaCppBackend` adapts that to `LocalEngine.NativeBackend`, applying the Gemma
  chat template (`GemmaPrompt`). `ModelManager` owns the lifecycle and hands
  `LocalEngine` a backend provider, so the active model swaps at runtime without
  rebuilding the router.
- The JNI is written against llama.cpp's current C API and avoids the `common`
  helper lib (batches are filled inline), keeping the build to a single small
  `libllama-android.so` plus the ggml backends.

### Streaming

`InferenceEngine.generate` returns `Flow<String>`. `PrivacyRouter` decides
route/redaction synchronously and returns a `StreamingOutcome` carrying the token
flow; `ChatRepository` seeds an empty reply and appends deltas as they arrive, so
the UI streams live off the existing `conversation` StateFlow.
