# Changelog

All notable changes to Domain AI are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.05] — 2026-06-25

### Performance
- **Adaptive generation threads.** Thread count is now chosen from the device's
  **performance-core count** (probed once at startup) instead of a hardcoded 4, so
  inference uses the fast cores on flagships and avoids dragging in the slow little
  cores on budget phones (which also keeps the UI responsive). Flash attention was
  verified already auto-enabled.

### Fixed
- **Consistent model selection.** The chat top-bar subtitle, the quick-panel
  checkmark, and Settings' "In use" now always agree on the active on-device model,
  including while a model is loading.
- **A failed download no longer disrupts the model you're using.** A download or
  import that fails surfaces its own error and leaves the loaded model untouched.

### Changed
- **Downloads and imports are their own visible process.** Acquiring a model now
  shows real progress ("Downloading X — 42%" / "Importing X…") in both chat and
  Settings, distinct from "Loading on-device model…" — which now means only loading
  into memory.

### Internal
- All user-facing strings moved to `res/values/strings.xml` (the pure-Kotlin,
  JVM-tested privacy core stays Android-free by design).
- Docs: refined README (badges, release link, tech-stack table), added
  `docs/MODEL_SELECTION.md`, generalized model-specific references, and corrected the
  cloud-privacy description (PII redaction + the post-send "Sent (redacted)" badge;
  the see-before-send dialog was removed).

## [1.01] — 2026-06-23

First public release.

### Features
- **Local-first chat** — replies generated on-device by default with zero network
  access; the cloud is strictly opt-in per message.
- **Network kill switch** — a single, code-enforced chokepoint that makes outbound
  requests impossible; on by default.
- **See-before-send** — shows the exact redacted payload before any cloud call and
  waits for confirmation.
- **PII redaction** — strips emails, phone numbers, SSNs, cards and IPs before a
  cloud request.
- **Routing transparency** — every reply is badged *On-device*, *Cloud*, or
  *Blocked*.
- **Encrypted at rest** — conversations stored in an AES-256 file keyed by the
  Android Keystore; backups disabled; no analytics/trackers (crash reporting is
  opt-in, off by default).
- **GPU acceleration** with an in-app CPU-vs-GPU benchmark.
- **User-configurable context window** (Auto or fixed, bounded by device RAM) from
  Settings and a chat quick-panel.
- **On-device model management** — download a GGUF model in-app or import your own.
- **Reply length follows the context window** — output is bounded by the chosen
  context size rather than a fixed token cap, so long answers finish on their own.

### Fixed
- Chat history no longer vanishes after closing and reopening the app. The
  encrypted store wrote conversations under a temporary filename and renamed it,
  but `EncryptedFile` binds ciphertext to the filename, so the committed file
  could not be decrypted on the next launch. Writes now target the canonical name,
  with crash-safe backups and recovery of previously unreadable history.

### Requirements
- Android 8.0+ (API 26), arm64-v8a devices only.
